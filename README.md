# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Included on this site are several lists of vocabulary, commands, and examples of how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to create a webpage such as this one. Understanding the basics and building a strong foundation can help any programmer fire on all cylinders once more complex language is implemented. Using HTML to fill out the notes and overall structure, CSS to add styles, and Javascript to add functionality, this site is a three-layered cake of basic web development.

## Usage

This study guide is structured section-by-section to help people over the hurdle of fumbling over commands and basic syntax. In the HTML section, many commands are listed to show what tools are available to build the foundation of your site. 

In the CSS section, the three methods of inserting style into a site are listed, as well as how to structure style choices. 

In the Git section, basic command line commands are shown in order to guide readers through the process of pushing and pulling changes to GitHub. 

In the Javascript section, notes about variables, methods, and functions describe how to create functionality for your site through for loops. 

For suggestions on what to study first, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). After doing this or right clicking and selecting "Inspect", a console panel containing a list of topics we learned from the prework should pop up. Randomly a topic will be selected as a suggestion to you!
